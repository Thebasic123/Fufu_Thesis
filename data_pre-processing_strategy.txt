This is my data pre-processing strategy for ZZAlpha Ltd. Stock Recommendations 2012-2014 Data Set 

This data set contains stock recommendation for every single trading day from 2012-2014 with around 50
different machine learning algorithms.

Since this data set only contains long and short information, we need to only select the information we desire.

1.only focus on analysis with both long and short recommendations, we only parse inputs with file format _LONG_SHORT_F.pdf

2.Since there are overlaps in each algorithms' daily analysis, we only keep track of those entries with the size of 20 

3.I use the data from 2012 and 2013 as training data to give each analyst a trustworthiness on a particular stock through iterative filtering algorithm, and use 2014 data as perdition data set to test the performance

4.Since we only have long and short data which is not ideal for the sake of this research, we also need
to gather data for hold(neutral) options on stock. The general idea of doing so is, finding the most active analysts for a certain stock, and find trading days which those stocks receive the most amount of
reviews, if some of the most active analysts do not make reviews on those days, we will treat them as hold.

5.In some of the data files,same analyst might make same predication for same stock more than once, we will only count this scenario as recommended once.

6.For iterative filtering data matrix, we use -1 for short, 0 for hold and 1 for long.

Some statistics of the data set(2012,2013):

Number of total stocks: 4335
Number of analysts : 39
Number of trading days in training data set: 391
